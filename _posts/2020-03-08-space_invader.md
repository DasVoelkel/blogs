Going through the tutorial on allegro is a real treat! whoever wrote it didn't forget ot have fun while doing it. \
The game example is extremly well made, and purposfully makes you want to play around with it and fix it. 



Space Invader is going t be the first thing I will programm and get to work, maybe I can even make it multiplayer playable, but I suspect for now I'll get that done and decide to build it more later.\
Now I really need to go to bed, I want to keep going, but it feels as if I'm going to burn out if I keep this up.
